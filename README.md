# TODO

- Expose an URL `/ext/wid/{wid}` that will redirect to the internal item identified by `wid` internally
  - this is for external integration
- Create page for wiki item
  - create backlinks section
- clean up the "index wiki page"
- clean up the broken links page
- `edit in github` for wiki pages
  - edit for existing pages
  - offer to create it if the wiki page does not exist
    - for this, the wikiLink component should be updated to redirect to a _new_ page telling that the "item with ID" does not exist
- Add a search page for wiki
- would be nice to list the commits that changed a wiki page (maybe something like page history)
- make headlines foldable
- add creative commons disclaimer to wiki item (footer?)
- Create a graph of depth N
  - Interesting for all the wiki articles starting (with depth = inf)
  - And also for a given article (with actual depth)
- Consider changing name of `wiki` to something like `knowledge`
  - since it is not really a wiki but an interconnected web of small concepts
