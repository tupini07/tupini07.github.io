Random network
==============

Leverages the existing torrent infrastructure to make nodes on the
network discoverable among themselves. Nodes will exchange messages and
the latency in message exchange will be used to generate randomness.
Number of hops increases randomness.

TS Transpiler
=============

Have a small typed language which is transpiled to TS, and the
type-checking is offloaded to typescript.

Match-3 game with undo
======================

Not infinite undo, but at least some. It can also be in an unusual
setting like *space*.
