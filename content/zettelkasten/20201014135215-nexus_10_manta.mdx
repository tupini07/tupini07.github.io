The nexus 10 was pretty much my first tablet and it still works pretty
well given that I manually update the ROM every couple of months.

# Installing a custom ROM

## Getting the ROM

Head over to the [XDA Nexus
10](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-10) page and search for a
ROM. A good thread is [this
one](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-10/development/rom-lineage-14-1-20170216-unofficial-t3557735),
which is a port of lineage for the manta. Download the *.zip* file for
the rom and place it in the root of the system storage for the device.

## Preparing recovery

In my experience, the best recovery image is TWRP. Head over to the
[official TWRP page](https://twrp.me/samsung/samsungnexus10.html) for
manta, download the latest image and flash it to the recovery partition.

To enter bootloader mode: press power + vol-up + vol-down

### Flashing TWRP

If it is necessary to flash TWRP then it is possible to do so with
`fastboot` by first entering into bootloader. Follow the instructions of
the TWRP site.

## Getting GAPS

Go to the [OpenGapps](https://opengapps.org/) page and download whatever
flavor is necessary. **Note** that manta has an **ARM** processor, so be
sure to select this one, and also select the appropriate android version
for the selected rom (if the android version is not correct they you
won\'t be able to install gapps).

Note that the *pico* option is quite good, sometimes if a big option is
chosen then an error while flashing may arise informing that there is
not enough space in the system partition (this space can be increased).

## [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Magisk {#magisk}

Magisk provides an interface to run android as root.

## Installing stuff

Boot into recovery, wipe *system, dalvik, and cache*, then head over to
*install* and first install the ROM, followed by the *opengapps*, and
then *magisk*. Reboot and everything should work.

Remember to check the install instructions of the rom provider, since
they may vary from case to case.
