Docker is the main containerization technology

# Tools

    docker installations via web interface. Supports both local and
    remote installations.

# Doing stuff

## Connecting to a host port from inside a Docker container

Suppose the case in which we have a DB server running on the host and
want to connect to it from inside a docker container. An easy solution
for this would be to use `--network=host` when launching the container,
but this is not always possible (or if you\'re using Docker on Windows,
at least not today: \[2020-10-15 Thu\]).

**Note:** In the future (pending the resolution of [this
issue](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/264)) we can use
`host.docker.internal` to access the *bridge* between container and
host. Although this functionality seems to be working fine in MacOS and
Windows.

In linux we can use the command `ip a` to find the IP address of the
`docker0` interface. We can then use this IP from within the container
to reference the *bridge*. See
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31328031/2234619) stackoverflow
answer for more details.
