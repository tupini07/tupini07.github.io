Cloudfront is a [!!AWS](WID:20200803144816-aws) service which provides a
CDN functionality for data hosted on AWS.

It is also commonly used as a *front* for web assets hosted on S3.

Using a custom domain with CloudFront
=====================================

See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)
for the complete documentation.

Basically, we just need to add the name as an *Alternate Domain Name*
for the distribution.

However, it is very possible that we also want to use a free certificate
given by [!!AWS-ACM](WID:20200803145314-aws_acm) for this. If this is
the case then we first need to request the certificate so that the
domain can be used, before adding the domain can be added as a valid
alternate domain.
