Cloudfront is a [!!AWS](WID:20200803144816-aws) service which provides a
CDN functionality for data hosted on AWS.

It is also commonly used as a *front* for web assets hosted on S3.

# Using a custom domain with CloudFront

See
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)
for the complete documentation.

Basically, we just need to add the name as an *Alternate Domain Name*
for the distribution, and create a rule in the domain\'s DNS so that
requests are *routed* to the CloudFront domain provided by AWS.

From CloudFront\'s documentation:

> Use the method provided by your DNS service provider to add a CNAME
> record for your domain. This new CNAME record will redirect DNS
> queries from your domain (for example, www.example.com) to the
> CloudFront domain name for your distribution (for example,
> d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net). For more information, see the
> documentation provided by your DNS service provider.

However, it is very possible that we also want to use a free certificate
given by [!!AWS-ACM](WID:20200803145314-aws_acm) for this. If this is
the case then we first need to request the certificate so that the
domain can be used, before adding the domain can be added as a valid
alternate domain.
