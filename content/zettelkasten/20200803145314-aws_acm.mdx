[!!AWS](WID:20200803144816-aws) service that allows to manage
certificates. It is both able to store external certificates (bought
from an external certificate provider), as well as provide certificates
directly.

It works very well with [!!CloudFront](WID:20200803144648-cloudfront),
and it allows to provision free certificates.

Getting free certificates with ACM
==================================

Note that the certificates will say that they\'re from ACM, but they at
least allow *https* communication.

To get a free certificate, go over to the [request
certificate](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/wizard/)
page. After filling out some simple information in the wizard (domain,
validation method), the selected domain for which the certificate is to
be issued will be validated according to the selected validation method.

If you have access to the registar email of the domain then that\'s the
easiest option. Else, the DNS validation option is also quite simple,
and basically consists of adding a CNAME entry to the DNS record so that
ACM can confirm that we\'re actually the owners of the domain. Said
CNAME entry is provided by ACM directly in the wizard.
