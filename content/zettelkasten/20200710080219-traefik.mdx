Its kind of a \"super reverse proxy\" like nginx, but specific for
docker services.

**From web page:**

TraefikEE (Traefik Enterprise Edition) runs on the edge of your platform
to route the traffic to your applications.

By splitting responsibilities between two planes, TraefikEE follows the
principle of \"Separation of Concerns.\" To ensure that sensitive
information only runs on a closed and safe environment, the control
plane is not exposed to the outside. As a result, any malicious action
from external traffic will stay stuck in the data plane and your
platform will stay safe. Moreover, TraefikEE only relies on encrypted
communications between nodes, to add an extra layer of security.
