<https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/>

Watchtower is an application that will monitor your running Docker
containers and watch for changes to the images that those containers
were originally started from. If watchtower detects that an image has
changed, it will automatically restart the container using the new
image.

With watchtower you can update the running version of your containerized
app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker Hub or your own image
registry. Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down
your existing container and restart it with the same options that were
used when it was deployed initially.

Just execute the container with the docker socket mounted.

``` {.bash}
docker run -d \
  --name watchtower \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower
```

It also supports pulling from private or authenticated image registries.

It can be set to watch only one, or a set of containers. Also it can be
used as part as a **docker-compose** file to only update the containers
defined in that stack.

It can send **notifications** of the updates via multiple channels (see
[doc](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/notifications/)).

It can be set to manage remote docker instances if the docker daemon
listens to TCP.
