Google Analytics if a very used system to track actions in a website. It
is provided as a free service by Google, and at it\'s most simple it is
very easy to integrate into an existing website.

Basically, to make a `GA` work on a website, you only need to add the
tracking code provided when you create a *property*.

The `gtag` function
===================

The `gtag` function is the main way of interacting with GA. The basic
shape is `gtag('<type>', '<key>', <parameters>*)`.

The most basic functionality is just to specify the *config* (which is
like registering a property with the library):

``` {.javascript}
gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXX-X');
```

More information about this can be found [in the
documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/pages).

Triggering events
=================

We can *register* arbitrary events with GA also through the `gtag`
function, in the following way:

``` {.javascript}
gtag('event', eventName, {
    eventCategory: eventCategory,
    eventLabel: eventLabel,
    eventAction: eventAction,
    eventValue: eventValue
});
```

These events will then appear in the GA dashboard and be there for us if
we want to analyze them.
