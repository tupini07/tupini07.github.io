Nuget is the de-facto package manager for .NET applications.

# Obtaining an API key

An API key can be easily obtained from NuGet to make it possible to
access the platform programmatically. This can be done in the top right
menu, under `API Keys`, or directly at [this
URL](https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys). API keys will expire by
default after a duration of *\~1 year* (at least at the moment of this
writing).
