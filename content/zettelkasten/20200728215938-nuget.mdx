Nuget is the de-facto package manager for .NET applications.

Obtaining an API key
====================

An API key can be easily obtained from NuGet to make it possible to
access the platform programmatically. This can be done in the top right
menu, under `API Keys`, or directly at [this
URL](https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys). API keys will expire by
default after a duration of *\~1 year* (at least at the moment of this
writing).
