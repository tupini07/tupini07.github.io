Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several
programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been
in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby
programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure,
Python, PHP, and Go. For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot
platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale
applications in a similar manner across most languages.
