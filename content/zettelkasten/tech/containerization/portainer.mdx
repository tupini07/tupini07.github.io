*Portainer* can be used to manage docker containers in a host (either local or remote). Mainly used for monitoring and quick diagnostics.

It can also be used to manage all other aspects of Dockers's infrastructure (images, stacks, networks, volumes, etc). It can also be used to set up *application templates*.

It provides the following useful functionality:

-   a web frontend
-   Shell access to container
-   container usage statistics
-   application templates

It also allows to manage *stacks* directly, which means that docker compose files can be managed and edited from the interface.


# Simple usage via *docker run*

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000
  --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer
```

Or use a bind volume if you prefer.

# Running the edge agent on *edge* systems

This is for remote systems that we want to control.

Just fill out the information in the FE and it will give the command to execute in the *edge* server to start the agent.

Note however that the *portainer* server needs to be reachable by the edge instance since this edge instance will periodically poll the server for instructions.
