Although not really useful in production, generating a self-signed certificate can be a great way to test the HTTPs
functionality of on application locally.

To generate a self signed certificate you'll need to have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed. Once that's
done, creating the certificate is as easy as running the following in your terminal:

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 \
            -nodes \
            -keyout private_key.pem \
            -x509 \
            -days 365 \
            -out certificate.pem
```

It will create two files. A private key file `private_key.pem` (used by your server/application to sign responses), and
a _certificate_ `certificate.pem`, which is used by clients to encrypt requests and verify the origin of the data.
