This is my personal cheat sheet of VIM keybings. Many refer to the _vanilla_ bindings for vim, but other are my own
custom bindings.

## Navigation

### Movement

| **Binding** | **Effect**                                 |
| `w`         | Move to the beginning of the next word     |
| `b`         | Move to the beginning of the previous word |
| `e`         | Move to the end of the next word           |

### Actions

| **Binding** | **Effect**                                   |
| `t` / `T`   | Till. Moves the cursor **until** a character |
| `f` / `F`   | Find. Moves the cursor **to** a character    |
| `{num}G`    | Go to line `{num}`                           |

## Special commands

| **Binding** | **Effect**                                                                                               |
| `;` / `,`   | When searching with `t/T/f/F` it moves the cursor to the next match (`;`) or to the previous match (`,`) |
