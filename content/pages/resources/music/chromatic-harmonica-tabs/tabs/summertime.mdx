SUMERTIME
By George Gershwin, Dubose & Dorothy
Heyward & Ira Gershwin
Key:Am


Sum-mer-time,
6    5   6
And the liv-in' is eas-y
-5   5  -5  6   5   -3 2
Fish are jump-in'
6     5   -5  -5
And the cot-ton is high
4   -3   4  -3  4   -4
Oh your dad-dy's rich
6   5    6   6    6
And your mam-ma's good look-in'
-5   5    -5  6    5    -3   2
So hush lit-tle ba-by
2   3    2   3  -3  4
Don't you cry
6-5    4   -3

One of these morn-ings
6    6   5     6    6
You're goin to rise up sing-in
6       -5   5  -56  5   -3   2
Then you'll spread your wings
6       5     -5    -5    -5
And you'll take to the sky
4     -3    4   -3  4  -4
But till that morn-in
6    6    5    6    6
There's a 'noth-in can harm you
-5      5   -5   6   5   -3   2
With dad-dy and mam-my stand-in by
2     3  2   3  -3  4   6-5   4  -3

Sum-mer-time,
10   9   10
And the liv-in' is eas-y
-9   9   -9 10   9  -7 6
Fish are jump-in'
10    9   -9  -9
And the cot-ton is high
8   -7   8   -7  8  -8
Oh your dad-dy's rich
10   9   10 10    10
And your mam-ma's good look-in'
-9    9   -9 10    9    -7   6
So hush lit-tle ba-by
6   7    6   7  -7  8
Don't you cry
10-9   8   -7
