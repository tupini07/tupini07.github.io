    Key: C - Diatonic


  6  -8 7   -7-6    6 -5   6 <br/>
Moon River, wider than a mile

4   -7-6     6  -5   6     4 -4
I'm crossing you in style, someday.

5     4   6 5   -4    4    6  5
Old dream maker, you heart breaker,

-4 4 5    6     7 -7   -6 -7 -6   6  -6
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way.

6   -8 -7    -7 -6  6  -5    6
Two drifters off to see the world,

  4     -7  -6  6  -5   6   4  -4
There's such a lot of world to see.

  5  4 5    6    7   -8  7     6
We're after the same rainbow's end,

-7 -6      6   -5    6   4  -7 -6 6 -5    6
Waitin' 'round the bend, my Huckleberry friend--

  4  -5 -4  5  4
Moon River and me.

  6  -8 7   -7-6    6 -5   6
Moon River, wider than a mile

4   -7-6     6  -5   6     4 -4
I'm crossing you in style, someday.

5     4   6 5   -4    4    6  5
Old dream maker, you heart breaker,

Wherever you're going, I'm going your way.

There's such a lot of world to see.
