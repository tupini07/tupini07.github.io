    Key: C - Diatonic


 5    6     6     6  6 -6 -6   -6
I've heard there was a secret chord

 5    6 6    6      6  6    -6    -6   -6
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

 6  -6   -6   -6 -6   -6   6  6  -5  6   6
But you don't really care for music, do you?

5   6    6    6     6   -6     -6   -7
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth

6    7     7    -6   7 7   -8
The minor fall, the major lift

7   -8  -8   -8   -8 8 8    8  -8 -8 7  7
The baffled king composing Hal-le-lu---jah


 5  6  -6 -6   -6  6  5   5
Hal-le-lu-jah, Hal-le-lu-jah,

 5  6  -6 -6   -6  6  5 -5 5 -4 4 -3 4
Hal-le-lu-jah, Hal-le-lu------------jah


 5    6     6     6   6   6   -6 -6   -6
Your faith was strong but you needed proof

 5   6   6   6  6   -6 -6   -6
You saw her bathing on the roof

 6  -6 -6  -6  -6  -6   6    6 -5  6     6
Her beauty and the moonlight over-threw you

 5   6    6  6  6 -6  -6   -7
She tied you to a kitchen chair

 6   7     7     7     -6   7   7    -8
She broke your throne, she cut your hair

 7   -8  -8   -8   -8   8    8   8  -8 -8 7  7
And from your lips she drew the Hal-le-lu---jah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


6  6  6  6    6    -6  -6 -6
Maybe I have been here before

5  6    6    6    6    -6     -6   -6
I know this room, I've walked this floor

6  -6  -6  -6  -6 -6  6  6  -5  6    6
I used to live alone before I  knew you

 5    6    6    6   6   6  -6 -6  -7
I've seen your flag on the marble arch

 7   7   7 -6  7  7   -8
Love is not a victory march

 7   7 -8   -8  -8  -8  8  8   8  -8 -8 7  7
It's a cold and it's a broken Hal-le-lu---jah


Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
