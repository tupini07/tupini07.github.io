    Key: C - Diatonic


-4 -4  -5  -5  -6 -6    6
Hello darkness my old friend

 4    4   4   5    5    6  6 -5
I've come to talk with you again

-5 -5  -5 -6 -6   7  7   -8   7
Because a vision softly creeping

 -5  -5   -6    -6   7  7   -8  7
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

-5  -5  -8 -8   -8   8   -9 -9  8  -8   7
And the vision that was planted in my brain

 -8    7 -6
Still remains

-5 -5  -5    7   5  -5 -4
Within the sound of silence


-4  -4 -4     -5  -5  -6   -6 6
In restless dreams I walked alone

 4  4     5    5   6  6  -5
Narrow streets of cobblestone

  -5   -5 -6 -6 7  7   -8    7
'Neath the halo of a street lamp

-5  -5   -5 -6 -6  7   7   -8  -8   7
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

 -5  -5  -8   -8    -8    -8  8   -9  -9 -9 8 -8   7
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

 7    -8    7   -6
That split the night

-5    -5    -5    7   5  -5 -4
And touched the sound of silence


-4  -4 -4  -5 -5  -6  -6  6
And in the naked light I saw

 4    4  4    5  5  6  6  -5
Ten thousand people maybe more

-5 -5  -6  -6   7  7    -8   7
People talking without speaking

-5 -5  -6  -6   7  7   -8 -8  7
People hearing without listening

-5 -5   -8 -8   -8    8   -9 -9  8 -8    7
People writing songs that voices never share

 7  -8  7   -6
And no one dare

-5 -5   -5    7   5  -5 -4
Disturb the sound of silence


  -4     -4 -5  -5  -6 -6   6
"Fools" said I "You do not know

 4  4    5   5  6  6   -5
Silence like a cancer grow

 -5  -5  -6    -6  7   7    -8    7
Hear my words that I might teach you

 -5  -5  -6   -6  7   7    -8    7
Take my arms that I might reach you"

-5  -5  -8    8   -9 -9   8   -8    7
But my words like silent raindrops fell

 5  -5 -5
And echoed

-5 -5    7   5  -5  -4
In the wells of silence


-4  -4  -5 -5   -6   -6    6
And the people bowed and prayed

4   4  5 5   6   6    -5
To the neon god they made

-5  -5   -6    -6     7   7   -8  7
And the sign flashed out its warning

-5 -5   -6    -6  7   7   -8  7
In the words that it was forming

-5  -5   -6   7     7   -8   -8 -8   -8 -8
And the sign said "The words of the prophets

 8  -9 -9   -9 -9   8 -8   7
are written on the subway walls

 7 -8 -8  7   -6
And tenement halls

 5    -5 -5   -5 -5     7   5  -5 -4
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence
