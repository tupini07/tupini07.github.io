    Key: C - Diatonic


7  -7  -6  6  -5
Fly me to the moon

 6  -6   7  -7 -6 6   -5   5
and let me play among the stars.

-6  6   -5  5    -4    5   -5
Let me see what Spring is like

-6 6-5 5   -4   4
on Jupiter and Mars.

-4  -4-6   -6    7  -7    6
In other words, hold my hand.

-3 4-5   -5      -6  6   -5  5
In other words, darling kiss me.

 7  -7   -6    6   -5
Fill my heart with song

 6  -6   7  -7  -6 6 -5   5
and let me sing forever more.

-6   6  -5  5  -4   5
You are all I long for,

-5 -6  -5 -5   5 -4  4
all I worship and adore.

4  -4 -6  -6      7    -7   6
In other words, please be true.

 6 -6 4    4    4 -4    4
In other words, I love you.
