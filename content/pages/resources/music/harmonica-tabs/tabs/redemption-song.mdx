4  -4  5  6     5  -5  5  -4  4


-6  6  -5  5  -5   6   6
Old pirates yes they rob I

-6  -6  6  -5  5  -5  -5
sold I to the merchant ships

 5  -4  4  4  -5   5   5
minutes after they took I

 4   4  4  4  -4  -4
from the bottomless pit

-5  -6  6  -5  5  -5  6  6
but my hand was made strong

-6  -6  -6  6  -5  5  -5  -5
by the hand of the allmighty

-5  5  5  -4  4  4  -5  5  5
we forward in this generation

4  4  -4  -4     5   6  5 -4  4
triumphantly   won't you help to sing

   4  5  -4  -4  4        4  5  6  -6  -7  -6
these songs of freedom    'cause all I ever had

   4  5  -4  4        4  5  -4  4
redemption song     redemption song


 5  -5  -6  6  6  6  -5  5  -5  6  6  6
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery

-6  -6  -6  -6  6  -5  5  -4  -5  5
none but ourselves can free our minds

5  -4  4  4  4  4  -5  5  5  5
have no fear for atomic energy

3  4  4  4  4  4  -4  -4
'cause none of them can stop the time

-6  6  -5  5  5  -5  6  6
how long shall they kill our prophets

-6  -6  -6  6  -5  5  -5          7
while we stan aside and look    ooohh

-5  5  -4  4  -5  5  5  5
some say it's just a part of it

 3  4  4  4  4  -4  -4
we've got to fulfill the book

.   5  6  5  -4  4          4  5  -4  -4  4
won't you help to sing   these songs of freedom

 4  5  6  -6  -7  -6
'cause all I ever have

 4  5  -4  4      4  5  -4  4      4  5  -4  4
redemption song, redemption song, redemption song


 5  -5  -6  6  6  6  -5  5  -5  6  6  6
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery....
